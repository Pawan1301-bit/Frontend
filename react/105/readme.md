# Why react
-we  can use states which means once we update the variable its changes all across the page
-we can split our app into multiple  components and reuse those components 
-react uses a virtual DOM to effectively update the UI  which is better than updating content using  DOM manuplation
-debugging and mantainance is very easy 

react is just a library. JavaScript mai likha hua code hai
